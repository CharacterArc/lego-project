# CSCI 4700 Potion Project
This project will be a unity based game where two players must communicate with each other in order to complete their task. 
One player must create a potion, while the other player must give specific instructions on how to make the potion via a manual.
This interaction is timed, so the players both must communicate well in order to complete the task.
