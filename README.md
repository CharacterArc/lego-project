# CSCI 4700 Lego Project
This project will be a unity based game where two players must communicate with each other in order to complete their task. 
One player must build a lego model, while the other player must give specific instructions on how to build the model via a manual.
This interaction is timed, so the players both must communicate well in order to complete the task.
